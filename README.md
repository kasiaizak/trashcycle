# Introduction

The idea of the trashcycle PWA is to help users in the field of household waste disposal - it contains detailed information about which container should be disposed of various types of waste. The introduction of the QR Code recognition mechanism, which will take the user directly to the appropriate tab in the application, is to simplify and shorten the search time as much as possible.

In addition, the application will contain elements of gamification, which will motivate for recycling. The user means what kind of waste has been thrown away and in return he is awarded points for this with different weight depending on the type of waste.
